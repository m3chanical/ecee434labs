# Introduction & Background

The previous experiment introduced the use of D-latches, how they operate, and their limitations. This experiment introduces a different kind of
latch called a flip-flop. A flip-flop differs from a latch in that it registers data while the clock is rising, rather than when it is high. A negative 
version can also be created. 

The purpose of this experiment is to build a positive flip-flop and characterize it. The D-latch from the previous experiment is used in this one to create the new circuit.

# Procedure

In order to achieve the objective of this experiment, the following procedure was followed:

*   Build a negative latch and show its functionality. 
    *   Use the latch circuit from the previous experiment
    *   Simulate its output using Spectre and show the graph. 
*   Build a positive flip-flop and show it's functionality
*   Using the defitions of hold time and setup time for flip-flops, characterize the flip-flop using those measurements.
